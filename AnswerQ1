Python is a popular computer programming language that was created in 1991 by a programmer named Guido van Rossum. 
It is designed to be easy to read and write, making it a great choice for beginners who want to learn how to code.

### Why is Python Popular?

1. Easy to Learn: Python uses simple words and symbols that are easy to understand. 
Even if you’ve never written code before, Python’s straightforward style makes it less intimidating to start learning.

2. Versatile (Can Be Used for Many Things): Python is like a Swiss Army knife for programming. 
You can use it to create websites, work with data, build games, control robots, and much more. 
Because it can do so many things, it’s useful in lots of different jobs and industries.

3. Large Community of Users: Many people around the world use Python, which means there are tons of resources available to help you learn. 
You can find lots of tutorials, videos, books, and forums where people share tips and answer questions. 
This big community also creates and shares helpful tools and libraries that you can use in your own projects.

4. Works on Different Computers: Whether you use a Windows PC, a Mac, or a Linux computer, Python will work on your machine. 
This means you can write a Python program on one computer and run it on another without having to change anything.

5. Good for Jobs: Python is in high demand in many fields, especially in technology and data science. 
Learning Python can help you get a job as a programmer, data analyst, or in other tech-related roles.

6. Lots of Pre-Built Tools: Python comes with many pre-built tools (called libraries) that you can use to do common tasks. 
For example, there are libraries for building websites, analyzing data, or creating visualizations. 
These tools save you time because you don’t have to write everything from scratch.
